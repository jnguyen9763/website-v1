Everything seems to be implemented correctly based on the HTML and CSS validators.

I used w3docs to implement the index.html file that would redirect http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jnguye14/ to https://jnguyen9763.github.io/. (source: https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-redirect-a-web-page-in-html.html)

It approximately took me four and a half hours to complete the assignment.
