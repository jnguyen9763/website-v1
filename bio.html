            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>My name is Jacqueline Nguyen and I'm currently a sophomore at
            Tufts University. I'm planning to major in Computer Science through
            the School of Arts and Science.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">A little bit about me:</span> I grew up in
            Boston, Massachusetts all my life. I attended Boston Latin School,
            which is the oldest public school in America. My parents were
            Vietnamese immigrants, making me and my younger brother
            Vietnamese-American.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">My dream right now:</span> to adopt a puppy!</p>
