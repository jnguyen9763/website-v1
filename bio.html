        <p>Hello! My name is Jacqueline Nguyen and I'm currently a sophomore at
        Tufts University. I'm planning to major in Computer Science through
        the School of Arts and Science. A little bit about me: I grew up in
        Boston, Massachusetts all my life. I attended Boston Latin School,
        which is the oldest public school in America. My parents were
        Vietnamese immigrants, making me and my younger brother
        Vietnamese-American. We also live with my grandmother. My dream right
        now is to adopt a puppy!</p>
